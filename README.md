## Foundation ##
We use Foundation v6.3 with the ['Float Grid'](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/grid.html).

We need code to work correctly in Internet Explorer 9+. Please avoid using the ’Flex’ or ‘XY’ grids as they do not support Internet Explorer 9.

## Style guide ##
For code efficiency and UI consistency we use a living style guide. The living style guide provides a set of standards for the use and creation of styles.

In the case of a standard style guide, the purpose is to maintain brand cohesiveness and prevent the misuse of graphics and design elements. In the same way, a living stye guide is used to maintain code consistency and guide implementation.

The living style guide can be viewed by visiting `/styleguide`.

### Style guide sections ###
The content is split into distinct sections. Most of the sections will appear in the PSD.  

### Variables ###
Contains an overview of SCSS variables defined in `/assets/scss/_variables.scss`.
If new variables are created, please consider documenting usage in the style guide's 'variables' section.
